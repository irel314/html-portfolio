<h1>The things I love to do the most by Ludovica Squillace</h1>
<h2>My top 3 of all of time</h2>
<hr />
<h2>Learning</h2>
Turns out I really love to learn new things and make connections

<h2>Playing Super Smash Bros Ultimate</h2>
I love playing Super Smash Bros.. <br />
It gives me the opportunity to travel around <br />
Europe and I hope the world. To see  <br />
my friends as well. Sharing a passion with them <br />
is for sure the best thing in the world.

<h2>Studying people</h2>
No comment about it. I love people.
